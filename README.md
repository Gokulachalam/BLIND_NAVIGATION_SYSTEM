# BLIND_NAVIGATION_SYSTEM

## Project Description
A blind navigation system using OpenCV could utilize computer vision algorithms to interpret visual data from a camera feed and provide audio or haptic feedback to guide the user. Features such as object recognition and depth perception could enhance the system's accuracy and effectiveness.

## Libraries Used

1.Python 3
2.Open cv

## Algorithms Used

1.YOLO

## Steps Done

1.Set up a camera to capture live video feed.

2.Use OpenCV to process the video feed and extract relevant information such as object location, distance, and direction.

3.Implement an algorithm to analyze the extracted information and determine the user's location and the desired path.

4.Use audio or haptic feedback to guide the user along the desired path.

5.Continuously update the user's location and the desired path based on real-time visual data from the camera feed.

6.Integrate additional features such as object recognition and depth perception to enhance the system's accuracy and effectiveness.

7.Test and refine the system to improve its performance and user experience.
